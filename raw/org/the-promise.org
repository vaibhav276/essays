* The promise

I sit down for a moment
just to try and unwind
I promise myself
that I'll make it work

It might not be obvious
I might not see where
I need not understand
but the promise is always there

The food is a promise
to fill my belly
The joke is a promise
to make a chuckle

What good is a laugh
if it doesn't bring joy
I keep telling myself
"Don't fail to try"

I am but a child
often late to remind
that promises are made
and broken all the time
