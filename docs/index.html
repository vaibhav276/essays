					<span class="description">
						
						I sit down for a moment just to try and unwind I promise myself that I'll make it work It might not be obvious I might not see where I need not understand but the promise is always there The food is a promise to fill my belly The joke is a promise to make a chuckle What good is a laugh if it doesn't bring joy I keep telling myself &quot;Don't fail to try&quot; I am but a child often late to remind that promises are made and broken all the time &hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						I was born in 1985. And the world has certainly changed quite a bit since then. And I can&rsquo;t help but reflect back on the role technology has played in it. But have I examined it properly?
Old world A couple of decades back, life was having slightly more uncertainty. You wake up early for school on a winter morning and find out there is no electricity today morning. You are waiting for the school bus for 30 minutes and realize maybe you missed it today because maybe you were a couple of minutes late at arriving at the pickup point and maybe today the bus was on time.&hellip;

					<a class="title" href="/essays/posts/art-computational-and-assisted-creativity/">Art, Computational and Assisted Creativity</a> &mdash;
					<span class="description">
						
						This is an essay about how I see art, what I think computational creativity is and some things I would like to express about assisted creativity. Before I begin, here is a disclaimer. I am not an artist, neither I am a computer scientist or an Artificial intelligence practitioner. I am just a software engineer, who keeps hearing about these things from various people around me and have thus formed an opinion on these things.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						One of the things that have worked well for me in the past few years of my career is that I have had the good fortune to interact with all kinds of people who applied for a position of software engineer in the company that I work for. While each interview I conduct is different from another in many ways because its dependent on many variables, there is one common thing that I say to the candidate almost every time — that the interview is going to last for about 45 to 60 mins and we will go through some programming exercises during this time.&hellip;

					<span class="description">
						
						Ever since I was a child, I have always found myself questioning the established norms about religion and god. The image of lord Ram with a bow and arrow, lord Krishna with a flute, or lord Ganesha with a elephant head and a bulbous belly are all examples of things that are so natural to one’s imagination. On the evening of Diwali, we used to keep our front door open and light up the whole house hoping for goddess Lakshmi to walk in and bless our home with ceaseless wealth and prosperity and on the evening of Holi, we used to burn the symbol of evil and feel tremendous about it.&hellip;
