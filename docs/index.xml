      <description>This is an essay about how I see art, what I think computational creativity is and some things I would like to express about assisted creativity.

      <description>One of the things that have worked well for me in the past few years of my career is that I have had the good fortune to interact with all kinds of people who applied for a position of software engineer in the company that I work for.
